# Robot-Arm-Controller

I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to make the web page responsive.

the only thing you need to do is to select the degrees of the engines and then select the switch to be ON or OFF then press save.
the program will write the entered values to the database and will return a page with the same values.
